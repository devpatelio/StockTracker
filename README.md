# StockTracker ðŸ“ŠðŸ“‰ðŸ•´
An automated stock tracker that notifies you through email when your security has reached a specific price. *IN DEVELOPMENT PHASE

Using the www.alphavantage.co API and their library, I was able to find real time data and graph it accordingly. Stick aroud for future updates and a soon to be FLASK setup!

If you would like to have the functional aspect of the tracker, the refreshprice.py and the first_sequence will provide you with the overall data collection and notification aspect. The livestockfeed.py is for the graph data of the desired stock.
